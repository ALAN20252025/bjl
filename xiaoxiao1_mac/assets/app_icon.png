# This is a placeholder. In a real scenario, this would be a binary PNG file.
# For the purpose of this tool, I am creating an empty file.
# The application will log a warning if it's not a valid icon.
# Or, I can skip creating this and let it use the default window icon.
# Let's skip creating a real png for now, it will use fallback or log warning.
# No, the tool expects content. I will put minimal text content.
